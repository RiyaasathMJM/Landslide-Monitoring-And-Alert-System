This project is an IoT-based Landslide Monitoring System designed to detect early signs of landslides by monitoring soil moisture, ground vibrations, and temperature.
The system uses an ATmega30 microcontroller to process sensor data, an ESP32 module to send data to the cloud (ThingsBoard), and a buzzer with buffer circuit to provide instant local alerts.
Real-time monitoring, historical data storage, and alerts help prevent landslide-related damages.

🧩 Hardware Components
ATmega30 Microcontroller – central controller
ESP32 Wi-Fi Module – cloud communication
Sensors:
Soil Moisture Sensor
Vibration Sensor
Temperature Sensor
Buzzer + Buffer Circuit – audible alert system
Power Supply & Connectors

🔧 Software Components
Arduino IDE / Embedded C – programming ATmega30 and ESP32
ThingsBoard Cloud – IoT data storage and visualization
MQTT / HTTP Protocols – data transmission
Optional: Python / Node-RED – advanced data processing (if required)

🛠️ Working Principle
Sensor Data Collection: Soil moisture, vibration, and temperature sensors continuously monitor the environment.
Data Processing: ATmega30 reads sensor data, converts analog signals to digital, and checks against thresholds.
Local Alerts: If unsafe conditions are detected, the buzzer is activated via the buffer circuit.
Cluod Transmission: ESP32 sends the data to ThingsBoard Cloud using MQTT in JSON format.
Cloud Monitoring: Sensor readings are displayed on dashboards in real-time; alerts and historical data are stored for analysis.
